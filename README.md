## 🚀 Featured Projects  

### [Justice Lens – API-Driven Media Bias Analyzer](https://justice-lens.streamlit.app/)  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Suhasini240/Justice-Lens)  
Built a **Streamlit app** integrating the **New York Times API** and **News API (Fox News)** to detect bias in media coverage of shared topics. Designed Python **ETL workflows**, applied **NLP (VADER sentiment, confidence intervals, Cohen's d)**, and built interactive dashboards to visualize polarity, volatility, and headline–abstract gaps (clickbait lens).  

### Enhancing Predictive Analytics for Subscription Retention  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Suhasini240/YourRepoHere)  
Developed a **logistic regression–based churn model** in Python and deployed it via **Streamlit** to predict subscription retention for WHOOP fitness wearables. Applied clustering (k-means) and random forests to identify high-risk user segments and recommend targeted strategies that improved conversion and retention outcomes.  

### Student Content Recommendation System (SKD Group)  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Suhasini240/YourRepoHere)  
Built a **user–item matrix factorization recommender** to personalize study materials, achieving a **17% higher CTR** over the baseline model. Implemented in **Python (scikit-learn, Pandas)** and version-controlled with **Git/GitHub (feature branches + PRs)**.  

### Demand Forecasting & Dashboards (Q4 Designs)  
Created a **Random Forest model** in Python for retail demand forecasting, achieving **1% MAPE**. Designed **PostgreSQL + Power BI dashboards** and client-facing reports, improving visibility into retail metrics and cutting report turnaround by **30%**.  

### Healthcare Analytics & ETL (Temple University Health System)
